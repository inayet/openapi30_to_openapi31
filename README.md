# OpenAPI converter app

The OpenAPI converter app converts an OpenAPI 3.0 spec to 3.1.

## Usage

To use the app, you need to provide two command-line arguments:

- The path to the input file
- The path to the output file

The input file must be a valid OpenAPI 3.0 spec. The output file will contain the converted OpenAPI 3.1 spec.

For example, to convert the OpenAPI 3.0 spec in the file `input.yaml` to OpenAPI 3.1 and save the output to the file `output.yaml`, you would use the following command:

#

```bash
openapi_converter.py input.yaml output.yaml
```

## Output

The output file will contain the following information:

- The OpenAPI version (3.1.0)
- The info object, including the title, description, version, and contact information
- The paths object, which maps paths to operations
- The components object, which contains the schemas and security schemes

## Reference guide

The following is a reference guide for the API of the OpenAPI converter app:

- `convert_openapi(openapi_dict)`: This function converts an OpenAPI 3.0 spec to 3.1. The `openapi_dict` parameter is a dictionary that contains the OpenAPI spec.
- `validate_required_fields(openapi_dict)`: This function validates that the `openapi_dict` parameter contains all of the required fields for an OpenAPI spec.
- `validate_openapi_version(openapi_dict, versions)`: This function validates that the `openapi_dict` parameter has the correct OpenAPI version. The `versions` parameter is a list of valid OpenAPI versions.
- `check_incompatible_inputs(openapi_dict, incompatible_keys)`: This function checks for deprecated keys in the `openapi_dict` parameter. The `incompatible_keys` parameter is a list of deprecated keys.

## Troubleshooting guide

If you encounter any problems using the OpenAPI converter app, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Make sure that the input file is a valid OpenAPI 3.0 spec.
2. Make sure that the output file does not already exist.
3. Try running the app with the `-v` flag to enable verbose logging. This will help you to diagnose the problem.
4. If you are still having problems, you can open an issue on the GitHub repository for the app.
