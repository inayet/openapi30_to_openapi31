## Description

Welcome to the **OpenAPI 3.0.0 to OpenAPI 3.1.0 Converter** repository. This collection of tools and scripts is designed to seamlessly convert OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications to the upgraded OpenAPI 3.1.0 format.

## How to Use

To efficiently convert your OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications to OpenAPI 3.1.0 format, follow these steps:

### 1. `openapi_converter_main.py`

This script is the heart of the conversion process. It takes an OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification in JSON format and generates a 3.1.0 YAML specification.

Usage:

```bash
python openapi_converter_main.py [input_file.json] [output_file.yml]
```

### 2. `useful.git-create-new-repo.py`

![GitHub](https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/github/github-ar21.svg)

Need a new GitHub repository? This script not only initializes a repository but also sets up main, production, and development branches for your project.

Usage:

```bash
python useful.git-create-new-repo.py
```

### 3. `useful.git-update-production-main.py`

Keep your production and main branches up to date with this script.

Usage:

```bash
python useful.git-update-production-main.py
```

### 4. `useful.git-update-development-production.py`

Update your development and production branches efficiently.

Usage:

```bash
python useful.git-update-development-production.py
```

### 5. `md_content_aggregator.py`

Asynchronously scan your directory to generate a content markdown file based on the files present.

Usage:

```bash
python md_content_aggregator.py
```

## Future Plans

As we continually strive to enhance and streamline the OpenAPI conversion process, we have some exciting developments on the horizon:

### 1. Automating OpenAPI Spec Retrieval

Our upcoming feature aims to simplify the acquisition of OpenAPI specifications. We're working on an automated mechanism to fetch specs directly from websites and API endpoints. This eliminates manual downloading, providing real-time access to the most current information.

### 2. Automated Conversion and External Validation

Our focus extends beyond conversion alone. We're in the process of creating an automated pipeline that not only converts OpenAPI 3.0.0 specs to 3.1.0 but also employs external tools to validate the converted files.

### 3. Enhancing Quality with OpenAPI API Validator

In our pursuit of accurate and compliant OpenAPI specifications, we're thrilled to integrate the OpenAPI API Validator into our conversion process. This powerful validator ensures the quality, accuracy, and compliance of your converted OpenAPI specs.

By incorporating the OpenAPI API Validator, we're taking proactive steps to eliminate errors and inconsistencies from your converted specifications. This tool empowers a seamless transition from OpenAPI 3.0.0 to 3.1.0 while maintaining the highest accuracy standards.
